# About

This is a small project to test out http://concourse-ci.org(Concourse) CI.
Concourse is a relatively new CI that purports to be better than Jenkins at doing container things. (It comes as a docker container by itself)
Currently, the project is setup to build and test once it detects changes in master on my Concourse docker container.
It is recommended to fork the original instead of this POS. And also follow the tutorial, otherwise it's worthless. (warning: materials in Japanese)
